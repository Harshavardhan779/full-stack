<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Harshavardhan â€” a passionate web developer with a keen eye for detail
  and a love for clean, efficient code. I specialize in building responsive and
  user-friendly websites that not only look great but also deliver exceptional
  performance. With a solid foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I
  aim to craft seamless digital experiences.
</p>

<p>
  My journey into web development began with curiosity and quickly turned into a
  full-blown passion. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful,
  and intuitive interfaces. Whether it's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or frameworks
  like React and Spring Boot, I always strive to stay updated and sharpen my
  skills.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond coding, I value continuous learning and teamwork. I'm always looking
  for opportunities to grow professionally and contribute to meaningful
  projects. If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat about
  tech, feel free to connect with me!
